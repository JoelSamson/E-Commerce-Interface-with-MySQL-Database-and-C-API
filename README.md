# E-Commerce Interface with MySQL Database and C API

## Implementation Details

The system is implemented using the C language and the MySQL C API to interact with the MySQL database. The user interface allows administrators to manage products, users to search for products based on specific criteria, add items to their cart, and make purchases. The system also handles generating purchase statements and applies appropriate taxes.

For the code implementation and detailed usage, please refer to the source code files in the repository. The MySQL C API access was provided by the University of George Mason.

## How to Use

2. Compile the C files using an appropriate compiler.
3. Ensure MySQL server is running.
4. Run the executable file to start the E-Commerce interface.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to navigate through the system.
